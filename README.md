# GitStats
GitStats is a lightweight ElectronJS app that allows you to view stats about GitHub issues on various repositories. This was created in 2023 for my High School IB Computer Science IA Project.

# Branch:rewrite
This branch is dedicated to a complete rewrite of the original GitStats app. Once completed, it will be merged into main and released under v2.

Here's why:
- I didn't know what I was doing in the original project, and ignored a lot of ElectronJS basics.
- The original is in JavaScript, and I want this rewritten into TypeScript.

# Contributing
This branch is open for contributions.

Running the code:
```
> cd GitStats/src
> npm install
> npm run full-build
> npm run start
```
